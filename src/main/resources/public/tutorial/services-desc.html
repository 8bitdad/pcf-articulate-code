<p>In this page we can exercise how applications in PCF can use
	services. By default the applications uses H2 as an embedded database
	but it auto detects and uses any PCF database bound to it.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
	<p><b>Warning!</b> Because it uses an embedded database, when running on PCF make
		sure you bind a database service when running more then one
		application instances. Since PCF load balances the requests, the results of the database interactions will be unpredictable. </p>
