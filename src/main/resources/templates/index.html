			<h1>Welcome to the Cloud Foundry Demo!</h1>
			<p>The purpose of this application is to demonstrate some basic
				capabilities of the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Platform, in particular
				the Pivotal Elastic Runtime Service which is the core component
				responsible for running the application workloads as containers.</p>
			<h2>How to use this Application</h2>
			<p>
				Each menu item above links to a page that helps demonstrate a set of
				capabilities. The last item, Spring Boot, highlights the Spring
				Framework project that helps build production ready cloud
				applications and microservices in minutes. Spring Boot is not the
				focus on this demo. <a href="http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/"
					target="_blank">Learn more.</a>
			</p>
			<p>Each page has the same layout with the Accordion control and 3
				groups:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Application Environment Information</b> - This provides
					information about the application environment when running inside
					PCF. You can see the Application Name, Container and Services
					information. This is useful to show things like load balancing,
					self healing, service binding among other things.</li>
				<li><b>Description</b> - We provide information on the current page
					and additional resources.</li>
				<li><b>Demonstration</b> - We list the things that can be demonstrated
					in the particular page.</li>
			</ol>
